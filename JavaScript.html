	<h1>Java Script</h1>
	<p>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website. </p>

	<p><b>Variables</b> are containers that store values.</p>

	<p><b>Comments</b> are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. </p>

	<p>An <b>operator</b> is a mathematical symbol which produces a result based on two values (or variables).</p>

	<p><b>Conditionals</b> are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not.</p>

	<p><b>Functions</b> are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code.</p>
